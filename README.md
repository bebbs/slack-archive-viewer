# Slack archive viewer

Dead simple plain HTML/JS/CSS viewer for Slack archives, with no dependencies. Useful if you are part of a Slack org that's not on a paid plan, so has limited message history.

Open index.html in your browser and navigate to an unzipped Slack archive to load the UI.

Several-shotted with Cursor, so YMMV!
